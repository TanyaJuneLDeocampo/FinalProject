                <h3>Equality Alone is Not Sufficient to Achieve the Equity Goal of Universal Mastery of Basics</h3>
                <p class="descript">
                    Recent PISA-D results reveal a learning crisis even among middle-class and privileged groups in many countries, highlighting that many education systems fail to meet international standards, not just for the disadvantaged but also for the most privileged. While the rhetoric around education equity often emphasizes bridging gaps between rich and poor, evidence shows that educational disparities persist within all socioeconomic groups.
                    ASER and Uwezo data show that learning on average is low across the board. Learning is low for both children from poor and rich households relative to any reasonable standard of minimal mastery of basic literacy and numeracy.
                    Achieving an international equity goal, defined as universal literacy and numeracy (which itself is quite a low bar for learning), will require more than just closing the rich-poor learning gap (that is, within-country equality across SES groups)â€”it will take progress in learning for all.
